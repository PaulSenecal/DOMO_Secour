# DOMO_Secour
This BTS project aim to improve services to its subscribers, a remote assistance company wishes to set up a system
information that will allow the implementation of rescue adapted to the situation of the victim, in the event of a sudden fall
with or without loss of consciousness:
            - Systematic call from a loved one.
            - Possible dispatch of an emergency rescue team (SAMU or firefighters) depending on the condition of the victim.
            
In the event of a loss of consciousness, the system must be able to give the alert automatically. The duration
immobility of the victim as well as the viewing of his condition by a teleoperator, will help to process the alert.

The technical solution to meet this need must integrate the following functionalities:
            - A fall detection system for the elderly or dependent
            - A mobile camera that can be controlled remotely by the staff of the aid station
            - A means of communication that will alert a close relative, a neighbor (ICE: in case of emergency),
                  or to send help if the condition of the victim seems to require medical intervention.
            - A means of communication with the victim (microphone / loudspeakers)
            - A system for saving information concerning subscribers to the remote assistance service.
